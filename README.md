Disclaimer: This app will be focused at first (v1) for my personal usage so don't expect any support.

So what I want to do at first is just let me visualize my animelist and show the detail of an anime but ultimatly I want to make it have different notification channels.

Why that? Well, I almost always watch anime at night but I need to know when an anime as been aired to be able to "fetch it" from any available sources (prefer legal ones).
So I would like to have a notification (on my phone) that tells me when an anime as been aired (in Japan), tell that I started downloading it so then when I come back home I can see the ones I'm able to watch directly.

This app is mostly to train myself too so it's going in every directions but that's my roadmap for the first version.
After completing this version I'll start a new major version that'll use allow the user to modify it's list but that will require a way to authenticate the user with my app on notify.moe.
